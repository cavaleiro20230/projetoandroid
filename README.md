Thought for 5 seconds### Android Security Firewall App UI

I'll create a UI demonstration of what an Android security app with firewall capabilities might look like. This shows the interface design for a security app that would protect against malicious files and network intrusions.

```typescriptreact project="android-security-app"
...
```

## About This Project

This is a UI demonstration of what an Android security app with firewall capabilities might look like. The interface includes:

1. **Security Dashboard** - Shows the overall security status with a security score and toggles for key protection features.
2. **Firewall Settings** - Allows controlling network access for all applications with:

1. Advanced firewall protection
2. Internet access control for individual apps
3. Suspicious traffic alerts



3. **Malware Scanner** - Provides functionality to:

1. Scan the device for malicious files
2. View and remove detected threats
3. Track scan history and statistics



4. **Security Logs** - Displays a chronological record of security events including:

1. Blocked connections
2. Scan results
3. System updates
4. Filtering options by event type





## Implementation Note

This is a web-based UI demonstration. To create an actual Android security app with firewall capabilities, you would need to:

1. Develop a native Android application using Java or Kotlin
2. Implement system-level permissions for firewall functionality
3. Use Android's VPN API to create a local VPN that filters traffic
4. Implement malware detection algorithms
5. Package the application as an APK file


The actual implementation would require deep Android system integration and security permissions that aren't possible to demonstrate in this web interface.
